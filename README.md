Basic steps to do the task:-
1. Collect Data:
Your dataset should contain the necessary columns, such as "Country" and "Population." Ensure that the data is up-to-date, accurate, and in a CSV format for ease of loading into a pandas DataFrame.

2. Load Data:
Use the pandas library to load the CSV file into a DataFrame. Pandas is a powerful data manipulation tool in Python, which provides various functionalities to load, manipulate, and analyze data.

import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_file.csv')


3. Analyze Data:
Use pandas functions to get summary statistics and gain insights into your data. The describe() method provides a summary of statistical measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.

# Get summary statistics
summary_stats = df.describe()

# Display the summary statistics
print(summary_stats)


4. Visualize Data:
Use seaborn and matplotlib to create visualizations. Histograms and KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) plots are useful for understanding the distribution of the data.

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set the style of seaborn
sns.set(style="whitegrid")

# Create a histogram with a KDE overlay
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(df['Population'], kde=True, bins=30)

# Add titles and labels
plt.title('Distribution of Population')
plt.xlabel('Population')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
